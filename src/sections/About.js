            <h2> About </h2>

            <p>
                I am a natural leader with a track record of producing highly scalable architecture, driving innovation and growing engineers.
                At heart I am first and foremost an passionate engineer myself, I constantly find ways to create pet projects in
                my spare time and love to learn about technology. Throughout my career I have demonstrated my
                ability to work in a programming language
                agnostic fashion, using the right tool for the job and as a leader I have helped to grow other
                budding leaders demonstrated the ability to successfully pick out the top talent from the crowd.
