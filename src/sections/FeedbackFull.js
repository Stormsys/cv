                <p>
                    <b>2023</b> - His exceptional leadership as the head of the Developer Platform engineering team has been instrumental in implementing numerous improvements within our developer ecosystem of tools and CI/CD. Diogo skillfully abstracted complexity, enhancing both productivity and security across the entire engineering department.
                                    <br />
                                    His ability to navigate intricate technological landscapes was evident in the consolidation of various technologies into a unified portal platform. This strategic move not only streamlined operations but also empowered our teams to work more cohesively. Diogo's dedication to supporting team development is commendable, and his leadership style, marked by clarity and a sense of enjoyment, has created a positive and collaborative work environment. Diogo's track record speaks volumes, and I am confident that he would be an invaluable asset in any company.

                    <b>2023</b> - 
                    Diogo joined Developer Platform team in a time when aspirations exceeded reach, prioritisation, workload management and morale all at the wrong ends of where they should have been. Diogo took that and created a positive environment, focusing on improving team cohension and aligning personal aspirations with strategic initiatives. Team morale improved he switched focus towards key initatives and how to maximise business value and aligning the team with platform engineering first principles how to foster cultural change within the organisation. Under Diogo's leadership multiple deliveries, service scoring being a key deliverable enabling teams to at a glance understand their service's compliance with the SDLC standard. Diogo is positive force in the team, rationalises prioritisation decisions and demonstrates pragmastism in leadership without a doubt an asset to any team.

                    <b>2023</b> - 
                    It was my great pleasure to be able to work and collaborate with Diogo for a period of time. When Diogo joined Checkout, our developer platform team lacked direction. Diogo brought a lot of technical and management experience with him to ensure direction for the developer platform team. Diogo always ensured he collected enough feedback and discussed with stakeholders to have a clear specification. He always was involved in discussion with various engineers at Checkout to find out the areas of improvement. 
                    <br /><br />
                    What I really liked about Diogo was his clear vision on what he wants to develop and deliver. He also ensured that vision is aligned with requirements and will improve upon what we already have in place.
                    <br /><br />
                    Diogo is a wonderful person and a great team player and I have no doubt he will bring a lot of value to any organisation he will work for.

                <p>
                    <b>2021</b> - In working with the Just Eat development teams, I came to appreciate the gut instinct of a few
                    individuals when determining the impact of changes we were considering. Diogo is one of those people.
                    I think he is one of the hardest working technical people we have. The teams he works with have gone
                    through a lot of change (in size and responsibility) and have never had a concern about the areas of his
                    responsibility. When Diogo moved to a tech manager role I was excited to see his progression into that space.
                    He is very passionate about the company and what can get done. Moving into a management role gives him the visibility
                    of the roadblocks he encountered as a senior tech level and the ability to influence and change those. Feedback from
                    his manager and his peers was always consistent and solid. He is a valued and trusted team member that I will continue to count on as
                    both a sounding board and problem solver for things we have to get done.

                    <b>2019</b> - I remember the first day we met on my first trip to FPH. It was in a capabilities meeting and I was impressed that of all the people in the room, you understood the nature of our true capabilities. You focused on our customers (the Ops team) and had defined your post it notes around their views instead of the narrower engineering perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have interacted directly on  a few projects and indirectly on many. What I have learned is that you have a passion for doing the right thing. In leadership it is likely the most important driver to success. I also found your logical approach to tackling issues to be very solid. I appreciate how you also switch between different levels of conversation depending on your audiences understanding of the concepts being shared. In brand management, at the early stage you made sure the people understand the basic concepts of the material rather than going on assumptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know your team respects you, your manager respects you and peers respect you. In a work environment like ours that is everything. It makes my job infinitely easier and has built a trust and confidence in your skills and competencies that I rely on.

                    <b>2021</b> - It's always a pleasure to work with you because you have a very good understanding of the
                    components of your team, are on top of your roadmap, know about the work from other teams and how it can
                    impact your and other teams' components, and you always try to focus on reliability and customer value over
                    "beautiful" work. You are very open to suggestions, and also very politely challenge decisions when you
                    think they might not be the best approach, which is very welcome.

                <p><b>2021</b> -I Really enjoyed our work together in 2021. From my point of view, your team has had a very,
                    very challenging and yet very, very productive year - you deserve an enormous amount of credit for how much
                    has been delivered in difficult circumstances. Some specifics:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pushing your team to think about the future of their services - Restaurant Events & Restaurant Management
                    in particular. Both of these have well-developed plans for their future and I've enjoyed working with (Name Retracted) and
                    (Name Retracted) on that. Thanks to competing priorities, RM hasn't had as much change delivered as we'd
                    all like, but having a plan is (more than?) half the battle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your input into the data retention / GDPR solution. You brought this to my attention as you were concerned
                    about centralising, coupling, messaging semantics, etc. I thought this was a great example of your keen
                    interest in software architecture and how it impacts team independence, which is a terrific skill for a
                    TM to have. Super, super helpful voice in meetings with (Name Retracted), (Name Retracted), etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking through the history of our Slack conversations, there are so many times where you've had to bat
                    away external forces asking you to compromise on software principles and/or your teams area of responsibility.
                    You're terrific at this; you have strong opinions about what you should own and what you shouldn't own.
                    Excellent stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your team had a large amount of unplanned SOX work. Very disruptive to your plans, very challenging
                    resourcing, but being able to advance your engineering roadmaps and reminding engineers of the importance
                    of their engineering decisions in the midst of that was super impressive to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think you do a fantastic job of involving me with the team and making sure that the team involve me in
                    their work. Please continue this!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's hard for me to think about what you could be doing better. I realise that your team is responsible
                    for an unusually large amount of functionality and I look forward to working closely with you and your
                    team on the challenges this brings.

                    <b>2020</b> - You've settled into the TM role superbly in 2020. Obviously we worked together a great deal
                    in your role as lead engineer, so it's been great to see how you've adjusted your approach as a TM.
                    You're still deeply involved in technical/engineering discussions and passionate about making things
                    better here. Specifically, thinking about our discussions about (retracted), authorisation and one (or maybe two!) PIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you're also passionate about your team and giving people the space (and projects) to grow and lead.
                    Here, I'm thinking about Brand Management (Name Retracted), FSA (Name Retracted) and the plans we've
                    discussed for organising the team into different focus areas. This combination of engineering, people,
                    product and architecture is what makes working with you and your team so exciting.
                    As ever, please involve me: I look forward to a slightly less ridiculous year ahead.

                        <li>Leadership - It is clear the team really respect you and look up to you as a leader. I think you set a great example for the team meaning the team are motivated and all pushing in the right direction</li>
                        <li>Coaching - I think you have a great balance of when to get involved and support the team, and when to give them the space to learn and figure out for themselves. I think you have created an environment in the team where I can really see people learning, growing and taking on more responsibility.</li>
                        <li>Knowledge - Your knowledge of our tools and JET in general is so valuable, especially to me when I have questions. You have shared knowledge with me on a number of occasions that has supported me in conversations with stakeholders and making decisions.</li>
                        <li>Morale - You have really kept morale high over a difficult period, especially towards the end of the year. You arranged a number of different things that the team have really appreciated and you are always keeping morale high by making people laugh etc. in the many team meetings we have.</li>
                        <li>Communication - I think you are a great communicator when we are on calls together and your emphasise your points really well. This is the case no matter how senior the stakeholders are, so it is clear you are very comfortable working with senior stakeholders. A specific example is the number of calls we both have to join and push back on things, you always articulate your point really well and it is often very hard for anyone to push back due to how well structured your point is!</li>

                    He is very easy to work with and it's very visible that he has the trust of all the engineers that report into him.  He gets involved in highlighting what the team needs to work on in the short term along with having a clear vision of where the team should be moving towards in the future.  His technical knowledge within our area is great and it shows in all Amigo's and refinement sessions.

                    freedom to carry out my role fairly autonomously which I appreciate. You have thus far always made
                    yourself available when I have needed your time which shows that you prioritise your team members highly.
                    You are balanced and intelligent about your management decisions as far as I can tell.</p>
