            <h2>(Name Retracted) - Head of Engineering - Just Eat Takeaway.com</h2>

            <p><b>2021</b> - In working with the Just Eat development teams, I came to appreciate the gut instinct of a few
                individuals when determining the impact of changes we were considering. Diogo is one of those people.
                I think he is one of the hardest working technical people we have. The teams he works with have gone
                through a lot of change (in size and responsibility) and have never had a concern about the areas of his
                responsibility. When Diogo moved to a tech manager role I was excited to see his progression into that space.
                He is very passionate about the company and what can get done. Moving into a management role gives him the visibility
                of the roadblocks he encountered as a senior tech level and the ability to influence and change those. Feedback from
                his manager and his peers was always consistent and solid. He is a valued and trusted team member that I will continue to count on as
                both a sounding board and problem solver for things we have to get done.</p>
            <p><b>2019</b> - I remember the first day we met on my first trip to FPH. It was in a capabilities meeting and I was impressed that of all the people in the room, you understood the nature of our true capabilities. You focused on our customers (the Ops team) and had defined your post it notes around their views instead of the narrower engineering perspective.
                <br/><br/>
                We have interacted directly on  a few projects and indirectly on many. What I have learned is that you have a passion for doing the right thing. In leadership it is likely the most important driver to success. I also found your logical approach to tackling issues to be very solid. I appreciate how you also switch between different levels of conversation depending on your audiences understanding of the concepts being shared. In brand management, at the early stage you made sure the people understand the basic concepts of the material rather than going on assumptions.
                <br/><br/>
                I know your team respects you, your manager respects you and peers respect you. In a work environment like ours that is everything. It makes my job infinitely easier and has built a trust and confidence in your skills and competencies that I rely on.
            </p>

            <h2>(Name Retracted) - Technology Manager - Just Eat Takeaway.com</h2>
            <p><b>2021</b> - It's always a pleasure to work with you because you have a very good understanding of the
                components of your team, are on top of your roadmap, know about the work from other teams and how it can
                impact your and other teams' components, and you always try to focus on reliability and customer value over
                "beautiful" work. You are very open to suggestions, and also very politely challenge decisions when you
                think they might not be the best approach, which is very welcome.</p>

            <h2>(Name Retracted) - Principal Engineer - Just Eat Takeaway.com</h2>
            <p><b>2021</b> - You've settled into the TM role superbly in 2020. Obviously we worked together a great deal
                in your role as lead engineer, so it's been great to see how you've adjusted your approach as a TM.
                You're still deeply involved in technical/engineering discussions and passionate about making things
                better here. Specifically, thinking about our discussions about (retracted), authorisation and one (or maybe two!) PIs.
<br/><br/>
                But you're also passionate about your team and giving people the space (and projects) to grow and lead.
                Here, I'm thinking about Brand Management (Name Retracted), FSA (Name Retracted) and the plans we've
                discussed for organising the team into different focus areas. This combination of engineering, people,
                product and architecture is what makes working with you and your team so exciting.
                As ever, please involve me: I look forward to a slightly less ridiculous year ahead.
                </p>

            <p>
                Diogo has been a pleasure to work with since I joined the team in October.
<br/><br/>
                He is very easy to work with and it's very visible that he has the trust of all the engineers that report into him.  He gets involved in highlighting what the team needs to work on in the short term along with having a clear vision of where the team should be moving towards in the future.  His technical knowledge within our area is great and it shows in all Amigo's and refinement sessions.
            </p>

            <h2>(Name Retracted) - Engineer - Just Eat Takeaway.com</h2>

            <p>Overall, I find that you are a straight-forward, practical, and supportive manager which allows me the
                freedom to carry out my role fairly autonomously which I appreciate. You have thus far always made
                yourself available when I have needed your time which shows that you prioritise your team members highly.
                You are balanced and intelligent about your management decisions as far as I can tell.</p>
